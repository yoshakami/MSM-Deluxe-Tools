a number was intended or there are less textures than your number
count the texture position in BrawlCrate
BrawlCrate doesn't only edit the texture data as this app does, but rebuild the whole brres when saving
that can damage the file (like destroy bind skin in Mario Sports Mix)
the number can be negative if you start counting by the bottom
no brres or arc file found
press enter to exit
this script will be replacing textures in this file
press enter to continue (compress + don't keep encoded textures) or
- type 1 if that's not the file you want
- type 2 to continue and keep the encoded textures when the program ends
- type 3 if that's not the file you want and you want to keep the encoded textures
-type 4 don't compress the edited file
-type 5 don't compress + keep encoded textures
-type 6 don't compress + keep encoded textures + that's not the file you want
Your choice : 
file name with extension
this file is not a brres or an arc file
Spotting all texture offsets in the file, please wait...
png name without extension
was not found in the current working directory
a png picture is intended
This file isn't a png
texture position
Error: the number can't be 0 (it can be -1 or -2 and more if you start counting by the bottom)
press 1 then enter to encode all png to tex0
or type anything else to add another png
replacing texture will override next header, this happens when you use twice the same png.
this texture will not be replaced, press enter to replace all other textures...
png name with extension
Did you opened external folder ???
Note also that all textures are counted for all brres in an arc or brres file.
press enter to go try again...
press enter to continue (compress at the end) or
- type 2 if that's not the file you want + don't compress
- type 3 if you don't want to compress your file when the program ends
texture name with extension :
a texture is intended
You didn't used a tex0 on this app that only works with already encoded textures.
try again
replacing texture will override next header
Success, press 1 then enter to exit

50 18 (no need to translate this line) the first number is the font size, and the second is the colour ID. '\n' or '§' is a new line, '\t' is a tabulation, and ¤36 16 is a new color (use spaces to fit it on where it was before, else it starts again at the beginning of the line) ---- Problems : changing font size also changes line size so using a big then a small font will make text collapse ---------- the function to auto-wrap at the right spot isn't perfect, to counter this you can make your line start with * so it won't auto-wrap and you'll have to manually do it.  /******************************************************************************************************/
23 31 Use this app after launching "Dump Textures". §§§¤20 23 This app will look for brres and arc in the current directory, which were already dump before.§§¤20 9 It'll then check which png were changed (with help from the file zzzdump.txt by calculating the sha256), finally, it will replace all of them in the file chosen.§§§¤18 9 (by encoding them to tex0 with wimgt)
20 30 The file changed isn't rebuilded, so it won't be corrupted because only the texture data changes.§§¤20 17 this software is useful to edit textures in external folder or do custom stages.
20 19 This app displays all thp files in the current directory. §§¤20 23 there are 6 different functions to manipulate these thp files (by clicking in the drop down menu). §§§¤20 22 OffsetsDataOffset is an int array (of 4 bytes each) with a length of 4 times the number of frame, and each int is the start offset of their corresponding frame
20 3 A checkbox can be ticked to overwrite the old file, else the app will create a new one
20 18 When using your custom brstm in game, if the song cuts out at the middle, it's because you didn't patched the brsar, brstm's max size are defined in it. §§¤20 0 This application is used to edit a brsar file by setting the max size of brstm files (linked into it) to the max value of a 4 bytes signed int (7F FF FF FF) which equals to 2GB max per brstm. You can also use PCM16 encoding, which uses 16 bits per sample, while ADPCM uses 4 bits per sample.
20 2 This software is compatible with every brsar, no matter their size or the game they're from. (please note that some brsar don't have any brstm link into them) §§¤20 3 In order to save Red_Star.brsar in Brawlcrate, you'll need to double click on the empty "External" element at the index 788, then click on the [...] next to the text entry, select Music00.mus, and click on OK.
30 5 haha, that's a surprise, click on it to know what it does
20 8 (off-topic)\n a Symbol Map is a heavy text containing a lot of in-game functions name, their size, alongside their offset in the ram. A Symbol Map is useful to create gecko codes because it helps to reverse engineer the game's code. §(it consists on understanding the game code by doing the inverse process of compilation to machine code)
25 24 The game's files are compressed with a special algorithm. §§¤25 17 In order to decompress them to arc or brres, you will need to use this application. It can also compress them back !
20 25 When decompressing them, it creates a file _DECOMP.bin §§¤20 28 A file extension is determined by the data inside it, not by its name. ¤20 29 §§When compressing again, the program tries to name the file with an adequate extension. In case its not the file name you want, simply rename the file. (don't forget to enable the option to see file extensions in Windows File Explorer)
20 2 This application is used to extract textures from an arc or a brres file, as well as making them compatible with the "Pack Textures" app, which can be used to replace them in the file afterwards. §§§¤20 18 With this goal, simply edit the png files right after dumping them from the file.
20 8 This Software can also convert a tex0 to png. §§¤20 21 A mipmap is a smaller version of a texture, used by the game when you're far away from the texture. §§¤20 27 All textures must have their dimensions in power of 2 ( 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 ) else your Wii or any console (or dolphin) won't display it correctly.

20 20 This app will be available after Mario Sports Mix V2 comes out
19 20 You must use this software to decompress Menu_DECOMP.bin or Tour_DECOMP.bin as well as other arc files (in the lyt folder). §§§¤19 23 Brawlcrate corrupts arc files when saving them, while Wiimms SZS Tools can create arc files with exactly the same data as the game's vanilla files. It always packs correctly (so if your file crashes, the cause should be the files inside the archive)
19 17 these files are called u8 archives because their first bytes are u8 when you open them in hex editor. §§¤19 18 Mario Sports Mix uses u8 files without compression (another app on this toolpack is used to compress them). §§¤19 19 This program is a Graphical Interface of wszst, it can also decompress/repack brres, szs, wbz, and other formats supported by Wiimms SZS Tools.
20 8 This app is only built to change the hockey cross colour when fighting Behemoth. It will only detect files having the model bstick.mdl0 (like c00B00_DECOMP.bin). §§¤22 27 A textbox entry is available to input your own colour like #7fff00, you'll then need to click on the button next to it for charging the new colour.
20 30 The actual colour is displayed on a button as #RRGGBB. Click on a file to transform its bstick color by the colour loaded in this software. §§§¤20 12 fix color is used to reduce the light amount of your custom colour because the game's adding more light. (the preview is the same as in game)
20 12 This program displays all png pictures found in the corrent working directory (cwd) and can convert them to tex0 with settings you choose. §§§¤19 27 Take a look at the Dump Textures image for an explanation on mipmaps, they correspond to LevelOfDetail + 1 on Brawlcrate.
20 2 The CMPR format is the only compressed one and uses colour alongside a 1 bit alpha. (a pixel is either completely transparent or opaque). It's from far the best colour format for the Wii. §§¤20 3 If you want to use a semi-transparent colour, RGB5A3 is advised, but the texture size will be higher.
